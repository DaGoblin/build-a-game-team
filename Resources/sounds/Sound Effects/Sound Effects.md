# Sound Effects
## Introduction
When building a COOL game, sound is one of the core elements. For our different arcade games, we found the following royalty-free sound effects that can be used.

This includes game over music (and potentially loop-able game music), jumping noise (for jump), collision/hit noise,and some audio saying "start!" and "game over", kick/punch sound, block moving noise.
